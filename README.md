### What I learned

DJ KHALED ANOTHER ONE!!! Ok, sorry for that. Let's right to the point:

I wanted to solve this challenge with the minimum use of media queries. For this reason, I decided to use just CSS grid. I started very well, but unfortunately I got stuck with the css grid from the rating section in the top right. I think I almost made it, but the results wasn't what a I really want it to look like.

I left the comment with the ```grid-template-column``` I was using (19 line from the _socialRating.scss file). So if you have any suggestion about this or anything about my approach I will appreciate it.
